What are some disadvantages of Shell scripting ?

Shell scripting has the following disadvantages:

. Errors are frequent and costly, and a single error can alter the command.
. The execution speed is slow.
. Bugs or inadequacies in the language's syntax or implementation.
. Large, complex tasks aren't well suited to it.
Contrary to other scripting languages, etc., it provides a minimal data structure.
Every time a shell command is executed, a new process is launched.
