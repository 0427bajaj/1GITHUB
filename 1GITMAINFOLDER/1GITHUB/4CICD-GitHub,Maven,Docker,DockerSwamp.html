CICID PIPELINE- deploy-build-test-release/deploy- automation of this process called cicd
**************************************------------------------------------------<br></P><p><p></p>
build+test= CI ( continous integration)
release(deploy)= CD  (continous delivery to user)
staging deployment-CD ( continousl deployment) manual step to approve then it will go to prod (continous deployment)
yml files- will have code to test

DEPLOYMENT VS DEPLOY
Deployment - mostly in sensetive data like bank
build - test- deploy staging- e2e test- manual approval- deploy in prod
Delivery 
build - test- deploy staging- e2e test- deploy in prod


DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
blue green dployment- keep two version- and if anything goes wrong on new we go back to old
curry deployment- traffic is moved to new versin, and slowly moved to new 
rolling- used on couple of users 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
War file is created by maven that has code and all the dependencies

Image is a copy of build but code size is reduced- it will automatically pull the dependencies rather than adding over and over - 

then we save this to the docker hub- it s like storage of images, image is push to docaker hub and keep in 

Creating docker hrlp in intalling  container - all latest image docker container have all docker hub container- then we push to the container

Ips we have to container mapp with dns, and dns provide to the user then it will hit the container

Docker swamp- swamp is replica- container replica- doing scalling- increasing or decreasing with docker swamp

Creating using docker- and manging container with k8 or docker swamp and aws is server

Argo cd is to check k8 container and portainer to check docker

Container is  a little part of the server- image is the code deployed on container-


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jekin server have connection with ssh ,
Developer push autmatically come to jenkin
 we maintain in genkin server, once developer push then it will go to jenkinwar
war file- maven build- war file created
sonar quebe to check the code- bug fixing
Then create image using war file /using docker/docker image get created and push to the docker hub-
Docker hub- repository- to maintaining images
Push code to docker- creating docker container- for more replica using docker swamp
Docker container- while using docker swamp to create replica
Then we are exposing the code mapping to dns
